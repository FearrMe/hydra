- removed counting
- changed voices (especially special that one was so loud/long)
- made buttons bigger
- made background color reflect current overhead
- added a small cooldown(1000ms) to phase change button to prevent accidental double clicks
- made it a lot less user friendly and basically only usable in 1 specific setup
